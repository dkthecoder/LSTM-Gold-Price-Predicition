# LSTM-Gold-Price-Predicition
Small project for my dissertation involving price predicition of daily gold price. Please note that the GOLDDaily.csv file has been preformatted for use with this project. Price input must be setup as shown;

  -Order newest data first.
  -Convert from comma split to column split.
  -Delete oldest values values (If this is not done, it will effect the scaling. I had used the first 2000 newest values).
